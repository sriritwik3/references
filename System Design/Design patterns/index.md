# Design patterns

Types of Design Patterns
Design patterns are classified into three main categories based on their purpose:

## Creational Patterns – Focus on object creation mechanisms.  
These patterns help in creating objects while hiding the instantiation logic, making the system more flexible.   
- singleton, factory, abstract factory, builder, prototype etc  

## Structural Patterns – Help in organizing classes and objects.  
These patterns help in forming relationships between entities to create flexible and scalable structures.  
- adapter, bridge, decorator, facade, flyweight, proxy etc  

## Behavioral Patterns – Define communication between objects.  
These patterns focus on how objects interact and communicate.  
- observer, strategy, iterator, chain of responsibilitym, visitor etc
