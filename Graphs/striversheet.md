# Graphs  
## Striver sheet  

# 1) Clone a graph  
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.  
Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.  
Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.  
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```  
To clone a graph, you will need to traverse it. Both BFS and DFS are for this purpose. But that is not all you need. To clone a graph, you need to have a copy of each node and you need to avoid copying the same node for multiple times. So you still need a mapping from an original node to its copy.  
### Using DFS  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        if (!node) {
            return NULL;
        }
        if (copies.find(node) == copies.end()) {
            copies[node] = new Node(node -> val, {});
            for (Node* neighbor : node -> neighbors) {
                copies[node] -> neighbors.push_back(cloneGraph(neighbor));
            }
        }
        return copies[node];
    }
private:
    unordered_map<Node*, Node*> copies;
};
```  
### Using BFS  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        if (!node) {
            return NULL;
        }
        Node* copy = new Node(node -> val, {});
        copies[node] = copy;
        queue<Node*> todo;
        todo.push(node);
        while (!todo.empty()) {
            Node* cur = todo.front();
            todo.pop();
            for (Node* neighbor : cur -> neighbors) {
                if (copies.find(neighbor) == copies.end()) {
                    copies[neighbor] = new Node(neighbor -> val, {});
                    todo.push(neighbor);
                }
                copies[cur] -> neighbors.push_back(copies[neighbor]);
            }
        }
        return copy;
    }
private:
    unordered_map<Node*, Node*> copies;
};
```

# 2) DFS  
Depth First Traversal is a traversal technique/algorithm, used to traverse through all the nodes in the given graph.   
It starts traversal through any one of its neighbour nodes and explores the farthest possible node in each path/branch and then starts Back-tracking.  
Backtracking happens when the DFS algorithm reaches a particular node that has no neighbours to visit further, once it reaches that node with no neighbours to be visited it’ll backtrack to its previous node (say N) and from this node N algorithm will start searching for unvisited neighbour nodes and starts visiting them.  
```cpp
class Solution {
    void dfs(int node, vector<int> &vis, vector<int> adj[], vector<int> &storeDfs) {
        storeDfs.push_back(node); 
        vis[node] = 1; 
        for(auto it : adj[node]) {
            if(!vis[it]) {
                dfs(it, vis, adj, storeDfs); 
            }
        }
    }
public:
	vector<int>dfsOfGraph(int V, vector<int> adj[]){
	    vector<int> storeDfs; 
	    vector<int> vis(V+1, 0); 
      for(int i = 1;i<=V;i++) {
        if(!vis[i]) dfs(i, vis, adj, storeDfs); 
      }
	    return storeDfs; 
	}
};
```
Time complexity: O(N+E), Where N is the time taken for visiting N nodes and E is for travelling through adjacent nodes.  
Space Complexity:O(N+E)+O(N)+O(N) , Space for adjacency list, Array,Auxiliary space.  
Also exists an iterative solution using stack.  

# 3) BFS  
An Undirected Graph will be given. Return a vector of all the nodes of the Graph by Breadth-First Search ( BFS ) Technique.  
We use a queue of pairs with the parent element also being inserted.  
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector < int > bfsOfGraph(int V, vector < int > adj[]) {
      vector < int > bfs;
      vector < int > vis(V, 0);
      queue < int > q;
      q.push(0);
      vis[0] = 1;
      while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        bfs.push_back(node);

        for (auto it: adj[node]) {
          if (!vis[it]) {
            q.push(it);
            vis[it] = 1;
          }
        }
      }

      return bfs;
    }
};
```
Time Complexity : O(N+E)  
N = Nodes , E = travelling through adjacent nodes  
Space Complexity : O(N+E) + O(N) + O(N)   
Space for adjacency list, visited array, queue data structure  

# 4) cycle in UDG using BFS  
```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    bool checkForCycle(int s, int V, vector<int> adj[], vector<int> &visited)
    {
        // Create a queue for BFS
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        visited[s] = true;
        q.push({s, -1});
        while (!q.empty())
        {
            int node = q.front().first;
            int par = q.front().second;
            q.pop();
 
            for (auto it : adj[node])
            {
                if (!visited[it])
                {
                    visited[it] = true;
                    q.push({it, node});
                }
                else if (par != it)
                    return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    bool isCycle(int V, vector<int> adj[])
    {
        vector<int> vis(V - 1, 0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= V; i++)
        {
            if (!vis[i])
            {
                if (checkForCycle(i, V, adj, vis))
                    return true;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
Time Complexity: O(N+E),  N is the time taken and E is for traveling through adjacent nodes overall.   
Space Complexity: O(N+E) +  O(N) + O(N) , space for adjacent list , array and queue  

# 5) cycle in UDG using DFS  
Also pass the parent element to the recursive call.

  public:

        if (!vis[it]) {
          if (checkForCycle(it, node, vis, adj))
            return true;
        } else if (it != parent)
          return true;
      }

      return false;
    }
  public:
    bool isCycle(int V, vector < int > adj[]) {
      vector < int > vis(V + 1, 0);
      for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        if (!vis[i]) {
          if (checkForCycle(i, -1, vis, adj)) return true;
        }
      }

      return false;

# 6) cycle in DG using DFS   
Normal approach wouldn't work. Eg below  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56584349/180603631-db708cf3-c2a6-4ed4-a2ca-3174a4a6e93a.png)  
To tackle this, we use 2 visited arrays.  One is normal visited and other is dfs visited. We mark both as one as same time. But whenever a recursive call is done 
for a particular node(i.e it no longer have any neighbours left) we mark it again to 0.  
So ideally, if we reach a node in the current dfs call which is already visited we can guarantee that there exists a cycle.  
```cpp
class Solution {
  private:
    bool checkCycle(int node, vector < int > adj[], int vis[], int dfsVis[]) {
      vis[node] = 1;
      dfsVis[node] = 1;
      for (auto it: adj[node]) {
        if (!vis[it]) {
          if (checkCycle(it, adj, vis, dfsVis)) return true;
        } else if (dfsVis[it]) {
          return true;
        }
      }
      dfsVis[node] = 0;
      return false;
    }
  public:
    bool isCyclic(int N, vector < int > adj[]) {
      int vis[N], dfsVis[N];
      memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis);
      memset(dfsVis, 0, sizeof dfsVis);
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (!vis[i]) {
          // cout << i << endl; 
          if (checkCycle(i, adj, vis, dfsVis)) {
            return true;
          }
        }
      }
      return false;
    }
};
```
Time Complexity: O(V + E), since in its whole, it is a DFS implementation, V – vertices; E – edges;  
Space Complexity: O(V), because, apart from the graph, we have 2 arrays of size V, to store the required information

# 7) cycle in DG using BFS  
We know that toposort exists only for acyclic graphs. So if topo sort ordering doesn't exists the graph is cyclic.   

# 8) Topological sort DFS  
linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge from u->v, u appears before v in that ordering.  It's only possible for DAG.  
- For Undirected graphs ,only u->v is not applicable . It cannot be sure whether the edge is between u to v or v to u ( u-v ) .  
- In a cyclic graph there will always be a dependency factor . You cannot make sure that you can have linear ordering of vertices.  
 Just because there was an edge from u to v. Dfs call will go from u to v. The 1st dfs (v) will get over first and then dfs(u). Here we are making sure that if u->v, then we will first push v into the stack and then u will be pushed. This is how Topological order is maintained in the Stack.  
```cpp
class Solution {
  void findTopoSort(int node, vector < int > & vis, stack < int > & st, vector < int > adj[]) {
    vis[node] = 1;

    for (auto it: adj[node]) {
      if (!vis[it]) {
        findTopoSort(it, vis, st, adj);
      }
    }
    st.push(node);
  }
  public:
    vector < int > topoSort(int N, vector < int > adj[]) {
      stack < int > st;
      vector < int > vis(N, 0);
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (vis[i] == 0) {
          findTopoSort(i, vis, st, adj);
        }
      }
      vector < int > topo;
      while (!st.empty()) {
        topo.push_back(st.top());
        st.pop();
      }
      return topo;

    }
};
```
Time Complexity: O(N+E)  
N = Number of node , E = Number of Edges

# 9) Topological sort BFS  
**Intuition:**  
The question states that if there is an edge between u and v then u should appear before v, Which means we have to start this question from a node that doesn’t have any previous edges. But how to find that node that has no edge before if? Here, we use the concept of in-degree (Number of edges pointing toward a node). We find an in-degree which has indegree=0 and we start from this. We use the Indegree concept to find topological sorting. Let’s see how.  

**Approach:**  

- In order to maintain the In-degree of each and every node, we take an array of size v( where v is the number of nodes).  
- Find in-degree of all nodes and fill them in an array
- Now take Queue data structure and add nodes that have in-degree is 0 (as we discussed in the intuition), and simply apply bfs on queue with some condition.
- Take the top/peek node from Queue ( let the popped node be x), add this x to our answer. (If you can observe clearly the above step is nothing but Normal BFS traversal).  
	- We’ll apply some conditions to the BFS:
	- Now take neighbour nodes of popped nodes and reduce their in-degree by 1.
- Check if any of the popped element nodes in degree becomes 0, after reducing in-degree by 1 if it happens then add this neighbour element to the queue for which the in-degree became zero.
- Repeat step 4 till the queue becomes empty.

	    for(int i = 0;i<N;i++) {
	        for(auto it: adj[i]) {
	            indegree[it]++; 
	        }
	    }
	    
	    for(int i = 0;i<N;i++) {
	        if(indegree[i] == 0) {
	            q.push(i); 
	        }
	    }
	    vector<int> topo;
	    while(!q.empty()) {
	        int node = q.front(); 
	        q.pop(); 
	        topo.push_back(node);
	        for(auto it : adj[node]) {
	            indegree[it]--;
	            if(indegree[it] == 0) {

# 10) Number of Islands  
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.  
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.  
As said in the question, a group of 1's is an Island. So try to eliminate a group of 1 using BSF and increment the counter meanwhile    

```cpp
class Solution {

        int m = grid.size(), n = m ? grid[0].size() : 0, islands = 0, offsets[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    islands++;
                    grid[i][j] = '0';
                    queue<pair<int, int>> todo;

                        pair<int, int> p = todo.front();
                        todo.pop();
                        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
                            int r = p.first + offsets[k], c = p.second + offsets[k + 1];
                            if (r >= 0 && r < m && c >= 0 && c < n && grid[r][c] == '1') {

# 11) Bipartite check using DFS   
Given is a 2D adjacency list representation of a graph. Check whether the graph is Bipartite graph. (Note: In a Bipartite graph, one can color all the nodes with exactly 2 colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color)  
Normally except for the case where there is an odd length cycle in the graph, every time it's bipartite.  
If the current neighbor is already colored, we check its color and the variable, node’s color. We know that they are adjacent nodes, if the colors are the same, we can infer that it is not a Bipartite graph, so returning false, else returning true.

                visited[i] = 1 ^ visited[node];

SCC means - a component in which if we take any node and reachout to every other node in that component.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56584349/180655974-b61c2323-2a67-4c1e-aede-190fd60483bc.png)  
We definitely cannot do DFS because we would end up visiting all nodes in a CC and couldn't find SCC.  
So we could do one thing i.e do dfs by visiting the nodes in reverse order such that there will be no way in which we go back if it's not an scc.  
For this numbering, we may need to use toposort ordering and follow it in reverse.  
- Sort all the nodes according to their topo sort(loosely based topo sort as we may have cycles here)  
- Transpose the graph i.e reverse all the edges of the graph  
- Use the topo sort or the increasing order of finishing time to find the strongly connected components using DFS.  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void dfs(int node, stack<int> &st, vector<int> &vis, vector<int> adj[]) {
    vis[node] = 1; 
    for(auto it: adj[node]) {
        if(!vis[it]) {
            dfs(it, st, vis, adj); 
        }
    }
    
    st.push(node); 
}
void revDfs(int node, vector<int> &vis, vector<int> transpose[]) {
    cout << node << " "; 
    vis[node] = 1; 
    for(auto it: transpose[node]) {
        if(!vis[it]) {
            revDfs(it, vis, transpose); 
        }
    }
}
int main() {
    int n=6, m=7;
	vector<int> adj[n+1]; 
	adj[1].push_back(3);
	adj[2].push_back(1);
	adj[3].push_back(2);
	adj[3].push_back(5);
	adj[4].push_back(6);
	adj[5].push_back(4);
	adj[6].push_back(5);
	stack<int> st;
	vector<int> vis(n+1, 0); 
	for(int i = 1;i<=n;i++) {
	    if(!vis[i]) {
	        dfs(i, st, vis, adj); 
	    }
	} 
	vector<int> transpose[n+1]; 
	for(int i = 1;i<=n;i++) {
	    vis[i] = 0; 
	    for(auto it: adj[i]) {
	        transpose[it].push_back(i); 
	    }
	}
	
	while(!st.empty()) {
	    int node = st.top();
	    st.pop(); 
	    if(!vis[node]) {
	        cout << "SCC: "; 
	        revDfs(node, vis, transpose); 
	        cout << endl; 
	    }
	}
	return 0;
}

# 14) MST using prim's  
Spanning tree - converting a graph to a tree such that number of edges are n-1.  Every node should be reachable by every other node.  
Minimum Spanning tree(MST) is a ST for which weights of all edges is minimum.   
**Prims**  
**Intuition:** Let’s start with anyone node in our graph. As the first step, we find out all the adjacent edges connected to this node and then pick up the minimum one. Now we have 2 nodes. We further continue this process but now we would consider all the edges connected to these two nodes and pickup the minimum one. We then continue this process until all the nodes are covered.  
**Note:** It might happen that while picking up an edge we might end up forming a cycle. In that case, we would pick up the next lowest edge that doesn’t form a cycle.  
We use three arrays to achieve this -   
- **Key** : This array holds the weight/ cost of the MST(intialized to INT_MAX except the index 0 which is set with value of zero)  
- **MST** : This is a boolean array which indicates whether a node is already a part of MST or not(initialized to false except the index 0 which is true)  
- **Parent**:  This indicates the parent of a particular node in the MST(initialized to -1)  

- Assuming we start with node 0, the index 0 in the key array is initialized to zero(because it is the first node in the MST). We find the index/node in the key array which has the minimum weight. We then find all its adjacent edges and pickup the the one with minimum weight.   
- Also at the same time we mark this node as true(indicating that it is now a part of the MST) and also set it’s parent as node ‘0’.   
- After this, we would continue to find the one with minimum weight in the key array that is not a part of the MST(Notice that this is where we ensure that we pickup the node with minimum weight and we do not choose an edge that might cause a cycle)  
- We continue this process until all nodes become a part of the MST  
```cpp
int parent[N];
    int key[N]; 
    bool mstSet[N]; 
  
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) 
        key[i] = INT_MAX, mstSet[i] = false; 
    key[0] = 0; 
    parent[0] = -1; 
    int ansWeight = 0;
    for (int count = 0; count < N - 1; count++)
    { 
        
        int mini = INT_MAX, u; 
  
        for (int v = 0; v < N; v++) 
{
            if (mstSet[v] == false && key[v] < mini) 
                mini = key[v], u = v; 
}
                 mstSet[u] = true; 
        
        for (auto it : adj[u]) {
            int v = it.first;
            int weight = it.second;
            if (mstSet[v] == false && weight < key[v]) 
                parent[v] = u, key[v] = weight; 
        }
            
    } 
    
    
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) 
        cout << parent[i] << " - " << i <<" \n"; 
```
TC - O(N^2), SC - O(N)  
We can optimise this by using a min heap instead of finding the smallest every single time in linear time.  
```cpp
int parent[N]; 
    int key[N]; 
    bool mstSet[N]; 
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) 
        key[i] = INT_MAX, mstSet[i] = false; 
    
    priority_queue< pair<int,int>, vector <pair<int,int>> , greater<pair<int,int>> > pq;

    key[0] = 0; 
    parent[0] = -1; 
    pq.push({0, 0});

    while(!pq.empty())
    { 
        int u = pq.top().second; 
        pq.pop();       
        mstSet[u] = true; 
        for (auto it : adj[u]) {
            int v = it.first;
            int weight = it.second;
            if (mstSet[v] == false && weight < key[v]) {
                parent[v] = u;
	    key[v] = weight; 
                pq.push({key[v], v});    
            }
        }            
    } 
    
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) 
        cout << parent[i] << " - " << i <<" \n"; 
```

# 17) Bellman-Ford algorithm  
While learning Dijkstra's algorithm, we came across the following two situations, where Dijkstra's algorithm failed:

- If the graph contains negative edges.
- If the graph has a negative cycle (In this case Dijkstra's algorithm fails to minimize the distance, keeps on running, and goes into an infinite loop. As a result it gives TLE error).
**Negative Cycle:** A cycle is called a negative cycle if the sum of all its weights becomes negative. The following illustration is an example of a negative cycle:

**approach**

distance array(dist[ ]): The dist[] array will be initialized with infinity, except for the source node as dist[src] will be initialized to 0.  

The algorithm steps will be the following:  

- First, we will initialize the source node in the distance array to 0 and the rest of the nodes to infinity.
- Then we will run a loop for N-1 times.
- Inside that loop, we will try to relax every given edge.
- For example, one of the given edge information is like (u, v, wt), where u = starting node of the edge, v = ending node, and wt = edge weight. For all edges like this we will be checking if node u is reachable and if the distance to reach v through u is less than the distance to v found until now(i.e. dist[u] and dist[u]+ wt < dist[v]).
- After repeating the 3rd step for N-1 times, we will apply the same step one more time to check if the negative cycle exists. If we found further relaxation is possible, we will conclude the graph has a negative cycle and from this step, we will return a distance array of -1(i.e. minimization of distances is not possible).
- Otherwise, we will return the distance array which contains all the minimized distances.

# 18) Floyd Warshall algorithm   
The Floyd Warshall Algorithm is for solving the All Pairs Shortest Path problem. The problem is to find shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge weighted directed Graph.   
We initialize the solution matrix same as the input graph matrix as a first step. Then we update the solution matrix by considering all vertices as an intermediate vertex. The idea is to one by one pick all vertices and updates all shortest paths which include the picked vertex as an intermediate vertex in the shortest path. When we pick vertex number k as an intermediate vertex, we already have considered vertices {0, 1, 2, .. k-1} as intermediate vertices. For every pair (i, j) of the source and destination vertices respectively, there are two possible cases.   
1) k is not an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We keep the value of dist[i][j] as it is.   
2) k is an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We update the value of dist[i][j] as dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]  
The following figure shows the above optimal substructure property in the all-pairs shortest path problem.  
```cpp
void floydWarshall(int graph[][V])
{
    /* dist[][] will be the output matrix
    that will finally have the shortest
    distances between every pair of vertices */

    /* Initialize the solution matrix same
    as input graph matrix. Or we can say
    the initial values of shortest distances
    are based on shortest paths considering
    no intermediate vertex. */
    for (i = 0; i < V; i++)
        for (j = 0; j < V; j++)
            dist[i][j] = graph[i][j];
 
    /* Add all vertices one by one to
    the set of intermediate vertices.
    ---> Before start of an iteration,
    we have shortest distances between all
    pairs of vertices such that the
    shortest distances consider only the
    vertices in set {0, 1, 2, .. k-1} as
    intermediate vertices.
    ----> After the end of an iteration,
    vertex no. k is added to the set of
    intermediate vertices and the set becomes {0, 1, 2, ..
    k} */
    for (k = 0; k < V; k++) {
        // Pick all vertices as source one by one
        for (i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            // Pick all vertices as destination for the
            // above picked source
            for (j = 0; j < V; j++) {
                // If vertex k is on the shortest path from
                // i to j, then update the value of
                // dist[i][j]
                if (dist[i][j] > (dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
                    && (dist[k][j] != INF
                        && dist[i][k] != INF))
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];

# Dis joint set union
https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/disjoint-set-union-by-rank-union-by-size-path-compression-g-46/

The disjoint set data structure generally provides two types of functionalities:

Finding the parent for a particular node (findPar()) 
Union (in broad terms this method basically adds an edge between two nodes) 
Union by rank 
Union by size 

### Union by rank 
The rank of a node generally refers to the distance (the number of nodes including the leaf node) between the furthest leaf node and the current node. Basically rank includes all the nodes beneath the current node. 

### Ultimate parent:  
The parent of a node generally refers to the node right above that particular node. But the ultimate parent refers to the topmost node or the root node. 

#### Initial configuration:

**rank array**: This array is initialized with zero.  

**parent array**: The array is initialized with the value of nodes i.e. parent[i] = i.  

The algorithm steps are as follows:  

Firstly, the Union function requires two nodes(let’s say u and v) as arguments. Then we will find the ultimate parent (using the findPar() function that is discussed later) of u and v. Let’s consider the ultimate parent of u is pu and the ultimate parent of v is pv.  

After that, we will find the rank of pu and pv.  

Finally, we will connect the ultimate parent with a smaller rank to the other ultimate parent with a larger rank. But if the ranks are equal, we can connect any parent to the other parent and we will increase the rank by one for the parent node to whom we have connected the other one.  

Now, if we try to find the ultimate parent(typically using recursion) of each query separately, it will end up taking O(logN) time complexity for each case. But we want the operation to be done in a constant time. This is where the **path compression** technique comes in.  

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
class DisjointSet {
    vector<int> rank, parent, size;
public:
    DisjointSet(int n) {
        rank.resize(n + 1, 0);
        parent.resize(n + 1);
        size.resize(n + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
            size[i] = 1;
        }
    }

    int findUPar(int node) {
        if (node == parent[node])
            return node;
        return parent[node] = findUPar(parent[node]);
    }

    void unionByRank(int u, int v) {
        int ulp_u = findUPar(u);
        int ulp_v = findUPar(v);
        if (ulp_u == ulp_v) return;
        if (rank[ulp_u] < rank[ulp_v]) {
            parent[ulp_u] = ulp_v;
        }
        else if (rank[ulp_v] < rank[ulp_u]) {
            parent[ulp_v] = ulp_u;
        }
        else {
            parent[ulp_v] = ulp_u;
            rank[ulp_u]++;
        }
    }

    void unionBySize(int u, int v) {
        int ulp_u = findUPar(u);
        int ulp_v = findUPar(v);
        if (ulp_u == ulp_v) return;
        if (size[ulp_u] < size[ulp_v]) {
            parent[ulp_u] = ulp_v;
            size[ulp_v] += size[ulp_u];
        }
        else {
            parent[ulp_v] = ulp_u;
            size[ulp_u] += size[ulp_v];
        }
    }
};
int main() {
    DisjointSet ds(7);
    ds.unionBySize(1, 2);
    ds.unionBySize(2, 3);
    ds.unionBySize(4, 5);

    ds.unionBySize(5, 6);
    // if 3 and 7 same or not
    if (ds.findUPar(3) == ds.findUPar(7)) {
        cout << "Same\n";
    }
    else cout << "Not same\n";

    ds.unionBySize(3, 7);

    if (ds.findUPar(3) == ds.findUPar(7)) {
        cout << "Same\n";
    }
    else cout << "Not same\n";
    return 0;
}
```

# Kruskal's algorithm for MST

The algorithm steps are as follows:  

First, we need to extract the edge information(if not given already) from the given adjacency list in the format of (wt, u, v) where u is the current node, v is the adjacent node and wt is the weight of the edge between node u and v and we will store the tuples in an array.  

Then the array must be sorted in the ascending order of the weights so that while iterating we can get the edges with the minimum weights first.
After that, we will iterate over the edge information, and for each tuple, we will apply the  following operation:  

First, we will take the two nodes u and v from the tuple and check if the ultimate parents of both nodes are the same or not using the findUPar() function provided by the Disjoint Set data structure.  

If the ultimate parents are the same, we need not do anything to that edge as there already exists a path between the nodes and we will continue to the next tuple.  

If the ultimate parents are different, we will add the weight of the edge to our final answer(i.e. mstWt variable used in the following code) and apply the union operation(i.e. either unionBySize(u, v) or unionByRank(u, v)) with the nodes u and v. The union operation is also provided by the Disjoint Set.  

Finally, we will get our answer (in the mstWt variable as used in the following code) successfully.  

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
            size[i] = 1;
        }
    }

    int findUPar(int node) {
        if (node == parent[node])
            return node;
        return parent[node] = findUPar(parent[node]);
    }

**Time Complexity:** O(N+E) + O(E logE) + O(E*4α*2)   where N = no. of nodes and E = no. of edges. O(N+E) for extracting edge information from the adjacency list. O(E logE) for sorting the array consists of the edge tuples. Finally, we are using the disjoint set operations inside a loop. The loop will continue to E times. Inside that loop, there are two disjoint set operations like findUPar() and UnionBySize() each taking 4 and so it will result in 4*2. That is why the last term O(E*4*2) is added.  

**Space Complexity:** O(N) + O(N) + O(E) where E = no. of edges and N = no. of nodes. O(E) space is taken by the array that we are using to store the edge information. And in the disjoint set data structure, we are using two N-sized arrays i.e. a parent and a size array (as we are using unionBySize() function otherwise, a rank array of the same size if unionByRank() is used) which result in the first two terms O(N).  


# Number of Operations to Make Network Connected  
You are given a graph with n vertices and m edges. You can remove one edge from anywhere and add that edge between any two vertices in one operation. Find the minimum number of operations that will be required to make the graph connected. If it is not possible to make the graph connected, return -1.  

- First we need to extract all the edge information (If not already given) in the form of the pair (u, v) where u = starting node and v = ending node. We should store all the edge information in an array.  
- Then we will iterate through the array selecting every pair and checking the following:  
- If the ultimate parent of u and v(checked using the findPar() method of the Disjoint set) becomes the same,  we should increase the count of extra-edges by 1.
- Because the same ultimate parent means the nodes are already connected and so we can consider the current edge as an extra edge.
- But if the ultimate parents are different, then we should apply the union(either unionBySize() or unionByRank()) method on those two nodes.
- Thus we will get the count of the extra edges. Now it’s time to count the number of components. In order to do so, we will just count the number of the nodes that are the ultimate parent of themselves.
- We will iterate over all the nodes and for each node, we will check the following:
- If the node is the ultimate parent of itself, we will increase the count of components by 1.
Otherwise, we will continue to the next node.  
This checking will be done using the parent array inside the Disjoint set.  

Finally, we will check the count of extra edges and the number of components. If the count of extra-edges is greater or the same, we will return the answer that is (number of components - 1), and otherwise, we will return -1.

# Account merge

Given: N = 6
accounts [ ] =
[["John","j1@com","j2@com","j3@com"],
["John","j4@com"],
["Raj",”r1@com”, “r2@com”],
["John","j1@com","j5@com"],
["Raj",”r2@com”, “r3@com”],
["Mary","m1@com"]]

- Here we will perform the disjoint set operations on the indices of the accounts considering them as the nodes. 
- As in each account, the first element is the name, we will start iterating from the second element in each account to visit only the emails sequentially.  
The algorithm steps are the following:  

- First, we will create a map data structure. Then we will store each email with the respective index of the account(the email belongs to) in that map data structure.
- While doing so, if we encounter an email again(i.e. If any index is previously assigned for the email), we will perform union(either unionBySize() or unionByRank()) of the current index and the previously assigned index.
- After completing step 2, now it’s time to merge the accounts. For merging, we will iterate over all the emails individually and find the ultimate parent(using the findUPar() method) of the assigned index of every email. Then we will add the email of the current account to the index(account index) that is the ultimate parent. Thus the accounts will be merged.
  
Finally, we will sort the emails for every account separately and store the final results in the answer array accordingly.

# No. of Islands ii
You are given an n, m which means the row and column of the 2D matrix, and an array of size k denoting the number of operations. Matrix elements are 0 if there is water or 1 if there is land. Originally, the 2D matrix is all 0 which means there is no land in the matrix. The array has k operator(s) and each operator has two integers A[i][0], A[i][1] means that you can change the cell matrix[A[i][0]][A[i][1]] from sea to island. Return how many islands are there in the matrix after each operation. You need to return an array of size k.

# Making a large island

You are given an n x n binary grid. A grid is said to be binary if every value in the grid is either 1 or 0. You can change at most one cell in the grid from 0 to 1. You need to find the largest group of connected  1's. Two cells are said to be connected if both are adjacent to each other and both have the same value.  

**Intuition**
The algorithm steps are as follows (step 3 is very important):  

- Our first objective is to connect all the nodes that have formed groups. In order to do so, we will visit each cell of the grid and check if it contains the value 1.
- If the value is 1, we will check all four adjacent cells of the current cell. If we find any adjacent cell with the same value 1, we will perform the union(either unionBySize() or unionByRank()) of the two node numbers that represent those two cells i.e. the current cell and the adjacent cell.
Now, step 1 is completed.  
- Then, we will again visit each cell of the grid and check if it contains the value 0.
- If the value is 0, we will check all four adjacent cells of the current cell. If we found any cell with value 1, we will just insert the ultimate parent of that cell(using the findUPar() method) in the set data structure. This process will add the adjacent components to our answer.
- After doing so for all the adjacent cells containing 1, we will iterate through the set data structure and add the size of each ultimate parent(referring to the size array inside the Disjoint Set data structure) to our answer. Finally, we will add an extra 1 to our answer for the current cell being included in the group.
- Now, we will compare to get the maximum answer among all the previous answers we got for the previous cells with the value 0 and the current one.
- But if the matrix does not contain any cell with 0, step 2 will not be executed. For that reason, we will just run a loop from node number 0 to n*n and for each node number, we will find the ultimate parent. After that, we will find the sizes of those ultimate parents and will take the size of the largest one.
Thus we will get the maximum size of the group of connected 1s stored in our answer.

**Time Complexity:** O(N2)+O(N2) ~ O(N2) where N = total number of rows of the grid. Inside those nested loops, all the operations are taking apparently constant time. So, O(N2) for the nested loop only, is the time complexity.  

**Space Complexity:** O(2*N2) where N = the total number of rows of the grid. This is for the two arrays i.e. parent array and size array of size N2 inside the Disjoint set.  

# Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column
There are n stones at some integer coordinate points on a 2D plane. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone. 

You need to remove some stones.  

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed. 

Given an array of stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the maximum possible number of stones that you can remove. 

**Intuition**
Intuition is very simple. In one connected component, u can remove all except the last one. so in every connect component one node would be left off.
so the answer is no of nodes  - no of connected components

# Flood fill algorithm
An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image. Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.  

To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same colour as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same colour as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the colour of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

**Time Complexity:** O(NxM + NxMx4) ~ O(N x M)  

For the worst case, all of the pixels will have the same colour, so DFS function will be called for (N x M) nodes and for every node we are traversing for 4 neighbours, so it will take O(N x M x 4) time.  

**Space Complexity:** O(N x M) + O(N x M)

#  Surrounded Regions | Replace O's with X's 
Given a matrix mat of size N x M where every element is either ‘O’ or ‘X’. Replace all ‘O’ with ‘X’ that is surrounded by ‘X’. An ‘O’ (or a set of ‘O’) is considered to be surrounded by ‘X’ if there are ‘X’ at locations just below, just above just left, and just right of it.

- boundary o's cannot be converted
- pick all boundary o's and traverse from them and all nodes reachable from boundary o cannot be converted

**Time Complexity:** O(N) + O(M) + O(NxMx4) ~ O(N x M), For the worst case, every element will be marked as ‘O’ in the matrix, and the DFS function will be called for (N x M) nodes and for every node, we are traversing for 4 neighbors, so it will take O(N x M x 4) time. Also, we are running loops for boundary elements so it will take O(N) + O(M).  

**Space Complexity** ~ O(N x M), O(N x M) for the visited array, and auxiliary stack space takes up N x M locations at max.   

# No of enclaves 
You are given an N x M binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and 1 represents a land cell. A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the grid. Find the number of land cells in the grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.  

**Intuition**  
The land cells present in the boundary cannot be counted in the answer as we will walk off the boundary of the grid. Also, land cells connected to the boundary land cell can never be the answer.   

The intuition is that we need to figure out the boundary land cells, go through their connected land cells and mark them as visited. The sum of all the remaining land cells will be the answer.

**Time Complexity:** O(N x M x log(N x M)) + O(NxMx4) ~ O(N x M), For the worst case, assuming all the pieces as land, the DFS function will be called for (N x M) nodes, and for every node, we are traversing for 4 neighbors, it will take O(N x M x 4) time. Set at max will store the complete grid, so it takes log(N x M) time.

**Space Complexity** ~ O(N x M), O(N x M) for the visited array and set takes up N x M locations at max. 

# Find eventual safe states - dfs
A directed graph of V vertices and E edges is given in the form of an adjacency list adj. Each node of the graph is labeled with a distinct integer in the range 0 to V - 1. A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node. You have to return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.  

**Intuition**  
If we closely observe, all possible paths starting from a node are going to end at some terminal node unless there exists a cycle and the paths return back to themselves. Let’s understand it considering the below graph:  
So, the intuition is to figure out the nodes which are either a part of a cycle or incoming to the cycle. We can do this easily using the cycle detection technique that was used previously to detect cycles in a directed graph (using DFS).   

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// User function Template for C++

class Solution {
private:
	bool dfsCheck(int node, vector<int> adj[], int vis[],
 int pathVis[], 
        int check[]) {
		vis[node] = 1;
		pathVis[node] = 1;
		check[node] = 0;
		// traverse for adjacent nodes
		for (auto it : adj[node]) {
			// when the node is not visited
			if (!vis[it]) {
			if (dfsCheck(it, adj, vis, pathVis, check) == true) {
					check[node] = 0;
					return true;
				}

			}
			// if the node has been previously visited
			// but it has to be visited on the same path
			else if (pathVis[it]) {
				check[node] = 0;
				return true;
			}
		}
		check[node] = 1;
		pathVis[node] = 0;
		return false;
	}
public:
	vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
		int vis[V] = {0};
		int pathVis[V] = {0};
		int check[V] = {0};
		vector<int> safeNodes;
		for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
			if (!vis[i]) {
				dfsCheck(i, adj, vis, pathVis, check);
			}
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
			if (check[i] == 1) safeNodes.push_back(i);
		}
		return safeNodes;
	}
};

	//V = 12;
	vector<int> adj[12] = {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4, 5}, {6}, {6}, {7}, {}, {1, 9}, {10}, 
        {8},{9}};
	int V = 12;
	Solution obj;
	vector<int> safeNodes = obj.eventualSafeNodes(V, adj);

	for (auto node : safeNodes) {
		cout << node << " ";
	}
	cout << endl;

	return 0;
}
```
**Time Complexity:** O(V+E)+O(V), where V = no. of nodes and E = no. of edges. There can be at most V components. So, another O(V) time complexity.

**Space Complexity:** O(3N) + O(N) ~ O(3N): O(3N) for three arrays required during dfs calls and O(N) for recursive stack space.

# Eventual safe states - BFS
The algorithm steps are as follows:  

- First, we will reverse all the edges of the graph so that we can apply the topological sort algorithm afterward.
- Then, we will calculate the indegree of each node and store it in the indegree array. We can iterate through the given adj list, and simply for every node u->v, we can increase the indegree of v by 1 in the indegree array. 
- Then, we will push the node(s) with indegree 0 into the queue.
- Then, we will pop a node from the queue including the node in our safeNodes array, and for all its adjacent nodes, we will decrease the indegree of that node by one. For example, if node u that has been popped out from the queue has an edge towards node v(u->v), we will decrease indegree[v] by 1.
- After that, if for any node the indegree becomes 0, we will push that node again into the queue.
- We will repeat steps 3 and 4 until the queue is completely empty. Finally, completing the BFS we will get the linear ordering of the nodes in the safeNodes array.
- Finally, the safeNodes array will only consist of the nodes that are neither a part of any cycle nor connected to any cycle. Then we will sort the final safeNodes array as the question requires the answer in sorted order.

			q.pop();

}
```
**Time Complexity:** O(V+E)+O(N*logN), where V = no. of nodes and E = no. of edges. This is a simple BFS algorithm. Extra O(N*logN) for sorting the safeNodes array, where N is the number of safe nodes.

**Space Complexity:** O(N) + O(N) + O(N) ~ O(3N), O(N) for the indegree array, O(N) for the queue data structure used in BFS(where N = no.of nodes), and extra O(N) for the adjacency list to store the graph in a reversed order.
